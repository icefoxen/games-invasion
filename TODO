Oh shit sound effects!
What sound effects do we need?
 * Bullet fire
 * Sword swing
 * Jump
 * Capture
 * Teleport
 * Invader hit
 * Enemy hit
 * Enemy destoyed
 * Invader destroyed
 * Building destroyed


Well we have sound effects now, but they don't freakin' work on Linux!  Ugh!

Destroying an engine should make the planet unsteerable!


Damage effects when someone is hit (invader should have green blood)
Clean up planet-snagging code and make it choose closest planet
Make cutting a vine work on either end of it
Graphics improvements:
 * Draw order
 * Vines?
 * Particles for blood, hit effects, vines/teleporter, breaking vines (fragments!), fire/smoke,
   planet rotation,
 * Fix graphics offset so things rest on the surface

Clean up universe gen code some...  Add minimap or other indicators?
Performance???  Can we profile?
Add more background buildings... cannons, maybe, plus invader buildings
Win condition: Conquer the universe.  Game over screens?
Powerups!
Skysmashers?


Impose draw order: Planets are lowest, then buildings, then civvies, then soldiers, then
invaders.  Particles are above planets but below everything else...
In case of overlapping planets, the planet the player is on should always be (re?)drawn last.
Small buildings should also be drawn before large buildings, so you get a background effect.

Powerups?  Different weapons?  Powerups could be longer vines, better weapons, healing, better
engine thrust/turning...



Mixing actual coordinates and rotational coordinates is a pain in the ASS.

I really should have a much more powerful and high-level set of combinators for object
interactions.  That would help a lot, I think.  But, no time to refactor!


Name:
Planet Pirates?


Other buildings:
Small shack
Medium house
Big building
Planet drive
Pirate houses
Defense bases?  Even if only decorative.



Base weapon is a bigass axe.

Skysmashers!
